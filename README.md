# scc-work-dbms
Completed and proposed an Automated Systems Database to Manager via SQL Server and MS Power BI Version. Centralized Relational SQL Database to help produce the appropriate roles for a position, creating consistency throughout departments and job titles (with the exception of optional roles for additional access) and reduce the number of access roles that are kept when changing positions. The DBMS unifies and consolidates system access to improve data security as well as onboarding and offboarding efficiency.
